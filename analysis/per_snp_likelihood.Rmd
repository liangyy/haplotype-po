# SNP-wise likelihood

At stated in the [initial idea](init_idea_outline.html), we let $g_i$ be the PRS which is aggregated across genome-wide SNPs. 
Alternatively, we can use single-SNP $g_i$ in replace of the PRS-based one.

Let's start with the base case that $y_i^1$ is the phenotype and $g_{i, k}^1$ represents the true genetic effect of SNP $k$. 
Here we consider the scenario with two SNPs.
We are interested in the likelihood of this scenario. 

$$\begin{aligned}
  \Pr(y_i^1 | V_e, V_g, g_{i, j}^1, g_{i, k}^1) &= 
\end{aligned}$$
